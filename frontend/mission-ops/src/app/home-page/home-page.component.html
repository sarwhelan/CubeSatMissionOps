        <h4>What is the CubeSat?</h4>
        CPSX, in partnership with Nunavut Arctic College, received a grant from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) to fund the development of a CubeSat device. The CubeSat is a miniature satellite set to be launched in 2021. The device will be designed and built by various teams composed of Western University & Nunavut Arctic College students and faculty members. Once the device has been launched, mission control will be able to operate the device from this mission control application.
